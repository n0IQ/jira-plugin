# Jira Plugin
In this project, we used Atlassian Plugin SDK to create a new Jira Plugin. Frontend is built using React and AtlasKit UI Library provided by the Atlassian Developer Tools.

## Features
- A new admin page which is only accessible to admin.
- Admin can view all of the projects along with its issues.
- Admin can delete the project.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **AtlasKit**
- **Jira**
- **React**
- **Java**

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
